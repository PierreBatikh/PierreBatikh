# 👋 Hello, I'm Pierre

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a first-year Computer Science student with a growing passion for software development.  
I love bringing ideas to life—whether it's a small script, a web app, or a quirky side project that solves a real problem (or just makes someone smile).  
I also happen to enjoy chess—especially the **London System**—so you'll find a few strategic metaphors sprinkled throughout this profile.  
I like my code the way I like my openings: **well-structured, flexible, and quietly aggressive**.

## ♟️ Dev Philosophy: The Greek Gift Sacrifice

In chess, the Greek Gift is a bold bishop sacrifice to break open the king’s defenses.  
In code, I sometimes remove a feature early—knowing it’ll lead to a cleaner, smarter solution later.  
It’s risky, but when it works, it’s beautiful.

> “Code like a strategist. Refactor like a tactician.”

Thanks for visiting! I'm always learning, building, and trying to improve.  
Feel free to explore my projects or reach out—I'm open to collaboration, feedback, or just a good chess match.

(# ♟️ Welcome to My GitHub Arena

Hi there! I'm a developer who codes like I play chess: with strategy, patience, and the occasional surprise sacrifice.  
I play the **London System** as White—solid, reliable, and quietly dangerous. As Black, I explore many defenses... except the Sicilian. We don’t talk about the Sicilian. 😅

## 🏰 My Coding Style = The London System

- **Solid foundations**: I build from the center out, with clean structure and reusable components.  
- **Quiet pressure**: I prefer elegant solutions over brute force.  
- **Surprise tactics**: I love refactoring that feels like a tactical knight fork.

## 🧩 Bonus: If My Commits Were Chess Moves...

- `git commit -m "fix"` → Bishop quietly retreats  
- `git commit -m "refactor"` → Knight forks two bugs  
- `git commit -m "add feature"` → Queen storms the board  
- `git push --force` → Blunder. Game over.
